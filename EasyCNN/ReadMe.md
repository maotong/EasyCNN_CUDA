Easy convolution neural network framework. Small, Clean, Easy to Understand!

[blog about EasyCNN in Chinese.](http://hongbomin.com/2016/11/12/easycnn-design-history/)

## Features
* All in one: without any dependency, pure c++ implemented.
* Basic layer: data layer, convolution layer, pooling layer, full connect layer, softmax layer, activation layers(sigmoid, tanh, RELU)
* Loss function: Cross Entropy, MSE.
* Optimize method: SGD, SGDWithMomentum.

## Examples
* mnist demo, with ConvNet and MLP net

## Todo List
* optimize network train/test speed, use cuBLAS/OpenBLAS etc.
